APPLICATION FAILED TO START

Description:

The dependencies of some of the beans in the application context form a cycle:

┌──->──┐
|  closeToday defined in class path resource [com/slp/module/wms/service/inventory/closing/InvnClosingService.class]
└──<-──┘


Action:

Relying upon circular references is discouraged and they are prohibited by default. Update your application to remove the dependency cycle between beans. As a last resort, it may be possible to break the cycle automatically by setting spring.main.allow-circular-references to true.
